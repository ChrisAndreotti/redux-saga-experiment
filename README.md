Simple React app that gets, creates and deletes users, with the goal of exploring [Redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) for managing application side-effects. 

This project explores the following key areas:
* Importing and applying Saga middleware to a Redux store
* Dispatching redux actions from sagas using `put`
* Creating watcher and worker sagas to make and manage API calls using ES6 JavaScript [Generator functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators#Generator_functions) and redux-saga effects `takeEvery`, `takeLatest`, `take`, `call` and `fork`
* Error handling within saga try..catch blocks

Please note, the application also relies on the following important dependencies:
* The [Herokuapp API](https://rem-rest-api.herokuapp.com/), a free, publicly available REST API for getting, creating and deleting users. No API key was required.
* [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) for UI and components

Examples are taken from the [Udemy Redux Saga course](https://www.udemy.com/redux-saga/learn/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
